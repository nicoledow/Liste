## About Liste
Liste is a web-based task and project managing application ideal for small teams with many items to accomplish. Upon sign up, users can register as either a manager or regular teammate. Teammates are able to see all lists (also called projects), tasks, and assignments. Managers have all the same functionality, but also have the ability to assign tasks and due dates to specific teammates. You can see this app live at: https://morning-refuge-29534.herokuapp.com/. 

## Dependencies
Liste requires the omniauth-facebook and bcrypt gems to facilitate secure login. It is recommended that the latest versions are used to ensure user data is secure.

## Installation
Liste can be run on a local rails server. Fork and clone this repository, then enter the following command in your terminal:
$ rails s 
This will default to running on http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
The database is configured using PostgreSQL so the application can also be deployed on Heroku.
